(i did not remove the paper to expose the adhesive on the nose wire) i also took the advice of another reviewer by taking a sharpie to place a mark to identify the inside of the mask when wearing in public spaces.put the mask on, adjusted the wire to my face and wore the mask around the house for about an hour while doing chores. i could breath just fine. then i went outside in the yard (temp was 85 degrees) to pull weeds for about 30 minutes and i could breathe comfortably. the added benefit of wearing this mask in the yard is that the mask front collected debris and dust that didn't get into my nose, throat or lungs. bonus, my eyeglasses didn't fog with the added nose wire.yes, i did the 'lighter test' and blew the flame out. i then added a non-woven filter into the mask and the flame did not go out. so what it's worth, this is a good investment to protect my health and those around me. these masks fit my face, are easily breathable, inexpensive to share with others and can be washed.\n\n  \n"}

(i do highly recommend, however, that the company makes it clear that there is no nose wire in the mask. i did hours of research and when i got to these, i thought my prayers had been answered because it looked so structured, i assumed there had to be a wire in it.) :(\n\n  \n"}

(i am attaching a photo of these. this is the way they came out of the bag without being worn at all.) some masks didn't have the wire nose piece at all.  about 60% of the masks were done correctly with the nose piece sewn in completely. all of the masks with the nose pieces that were not sewn incorrectly are falling off prior to the first use.  when you put the masks on you can't adjust the wire to your nose. it doesn't matter to me where they are manufactured, or in what country, the manufactured just had poor quality control. if you don't mind having some masks with a nose piece, then these would be fine for you. they are cheaply priced compared to others, so i guess you get what you pay for.\n\n  \n"}

(see the photo).overall, i think they're great masks for protecting you from lightweight or liquid items.  i do think they're a bit pricy at $6 each.  maybe this is due to the pandemic, but  i got a 3 pack similar masks from walmart for $5.  i have not opened the ones from walmart so i can't compare them.  even at $6 each that's still less than an urgent care or er visit co-pay!\n\n  \n"}

(and i still think they\u2019d look amazing tie-dyed if you already have dye available)\n\n  \n"}

(but at almost $20 per mask!).  i also tried masks from avocado green mattress which were reasonably priced but not comfortable.  i like these masks from amazon because i won\u2019t be upset if my kid loses them at school.the biggest hesitation in buying these were complaints from other reviewers about sizing.  the masks are all more or less the same size but there is some slight inconsistency in sizing and length of ear loops.  not enough to be a big deal.see my pics.  i took a picture of the packaging showing the rn number and country of origin.  i also have a pic of the mask before i washed (bottom mask) and after i machine washed in hot water with bleach and dried on high heat (top wrinkly mask).  some shrinkage but really not a big deal.the masks fit well over a 7 year old\u2019s face.  i have an average sized woman\u2019s face (admittedly a little fatter after gaining the corona15) and they fit me just fine.  they also fit over my husband\u2019s slightly larger than average head\/face.stay safe!\n\n  \n"}
